# Fixed by Discord. BROKEN

# NoLinkInvites

NoLinkInvites makes all server invites you send appear to have no link.

These "invisible" links will only work on PC. Mobile Discord will still show them, that's not something I can fix.

## Usage

Just send an invite to a guild in any channel or DM.

## Features

- [x] Works for any invite style.
